-> As I told you before, when writing unit tests,

  we should always look at the method of a test like a black

  box. So you shouldn't really write line by line of this code,

  and write unit tests based on this implementation, because its possible that

  this implementation has a problem, however, in this case

  because I'm not familiar with the domain of this application

  I have to rely on this implementation. So let's see what's happening


-> _statementSaver.Verify(x => x.SaveStatement(_housekeeper.Oid, _housekeeper.FullName, _statementDate),
                Times.Never);
